# 7DIFF

7DIFF is a project developed by three students during their second year of software engineering at Polytechnique Montreal. 
The main objective of the project was to teach students about web development, specifically the MEAN stack : 
MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node. 

7DIFF is based on the spot the differences game. To login and start playing, just enter a username on the login page and you're ready to go! 

Once redirected to the home page, you'll have access to all the games. You can play as a single person and try to find the 7 differences, or play against a friend and try to beat him/her !

Some games are in 2D, and others are in 3D using threejs!

## Begin playing
The first step to begin playing is to make sure you have node installed on your machine. After that, you'll need to clone the repository.

Once the repo is cloned and node is installed, make sure you run the command `npm install` in both the `client` and `server` directories. 

To start the server, just go to the `server` folder and run the command `npm start`. The server will start listening on `http://localhost:3000/`. 

To start the client, just go to the `client` folder and run the command `npm start`. The client will start listening on `http://localhost:4200/`. 

#### Have fun !
